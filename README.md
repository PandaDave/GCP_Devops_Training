## Little repo for devops training

./terraform does all the work.

api_requirements.sh -> a script to enable and run everything
main.tf -> all the modules. These could be split out for cleanliness 
terraform.tf -> the terraform provider and GCS bucket to store the state in
variables.tf -> variable definitions
variables.tfvars -> my sample list of projects that this repo was linked to
